nexusDescription="[center][size=32]New Vegas Uncut 6: If It Wasn\\'t For Betsy[/size][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/images/46574-1-1339361324.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[b][u]Overview[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nIf It Wasn\\'t For Betsy is the sixth in a planned series of mods restoring cut content back to Fallout New Vegas. This mod restores the cut companion Betsy the brahmin, as well as her related quest. It also enables two previously disabled NPCs. Only a brief outline of this quest was present in the game files, so much of this quest (and indeed all dialogue) is original content from scratch based on script notes that showed the original intention for the quest.\r\n\r\nBetsy is a non-humanoid companion who is unique in that she cannot enter combat. If the player does get into a fight she will simply run away until the danger is over. What makes her useful then, is her ability to carry vast numbers of items, the equivalent of two or more regular companion\\'s worth. She is therefore a useful companion for packrat style players who like to take a lot of gear with them. She also grants the player a new perk entitled \\'Trade Prices\\' that will give players a wholesale price discount of 10% when dealing with merchants.\r\n\r\nBetsy can be found in her pen outside Freeside\\'s North gate.\r\n\r\nI will post the solution to her quest in the comments thread so spoilers can be concealed.\r\n\r\n[u][b]What\\'s New [/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]V0.1[/b]\r\n\r\n- First version. \r\n\r\n[u][b]Installation[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nSimply extract all files from the archive to your FalloutNV/Data/ directory. click the \\\"Data Files\\\" option from the game\\'s loader and tick the box next to betsybrahmin.esp if you\\'re using the regular version, or betsybrahminFSO.esp if you\\'re using the Freeside Open compatible version.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re using Freeside Open, then make sure you\\'re ONLY using the file betsybrahminFSO.esp, and that it is further down your load order (which is to say it has a higher mod index number) than FreesideOpenPatch.esp.\r\n\r\n[b]IMPORTANT[/b]\r\n\r\nThis mod is currently NOT fully compatible with my \\\"Freeside Open\\\" mod. I WILL release a version that is in time, but for now it\\'s easier if I just keep this more universal version as the only one I have to work with.\r\n\r\nAlso, just in case there are any unforeseeable bugs (this is the first released version after all), it\\'s probably best to not put any unique/priceless items on Betsy until after her quest is finished.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Known Issues/Bugs[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n- This mod has no voice acting. If you\\'d like to volunteer to voice the characters, then get in touch. Please don\\'t do so unless you are serious, and have reasonable equipment to do so (i.e. not just some crappy old headest and Skype).\r\n\r\n- When leaving her pen Betsy may get stuck against the sides and run in place. This is due to her size and the game\\'s pathfinding. Simply walk a distance away and she will magically teleport through, or if that does not work, fast travel.\r\n\r\n- When Betsy is first bought she will not follow the player. This is intentional and done to alleviate the above. She begins in the wait state, so simply talk to her and either select \\\"follow me\\\" from the companion wheel or ask her to come with you in the talk dialogue.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Reporting Bugs[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nPlease post bugs in the If It Wasn\\'t For Betsy topic on the Nexus forums. \r\n\r\n[b][u]Credits[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nMod by MoBurma\r\nPerk icon by T3T\r\nBased on original code by Obsidian"
